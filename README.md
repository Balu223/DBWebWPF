# DBWebWPF
A university coursework that is an all-in-one project that fully showcases a layered, OOP application.

## Features
 * In-memory database that stores music records. The database consists of:
   * Labels
   * Artists 
   * Albums 
   * Songs
     
   * A custom-built website,
   * a simple console menu, 
   * and a WPF application,
 that all serve the same purpose, to give a GUI for the user to be able to interact with the database.

 * CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and non-CRUD methods
 * Unit tests that cover these methods.
## Structure

### 1. Client Layer

The client layer is responsible for handling user interfaces and user interactions. It is the outermost layer of the application.

### 2. Application Layer

The application layer contains the core logic and acts as an intermediary between the client and data layers.

### 3. Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for data storage and management.


### 4. Test Layer

Throughout the application, testing processes ensure that the application layer functions correctly and meets its requirements.
